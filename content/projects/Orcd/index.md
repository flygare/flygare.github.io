_orcD_, or _Operational Rated CDR Dashboard_ is a proof of concept to visualize rated [CDR's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_detail_record) on a heat and world map. It includes a HeatMap for visualizing CDR's that has gone through some rating/billing system which has a product tied to it. The GeoMap visualizes rated CDR's which has a roaming status in the record.

The project was made at the request of [Qvantel](https://www.qvantel.com) and was later made open source.

For this project I was the CI-master and a developer in the backend team.
