Graduated at BTH with a bachelors degree in Software Engineering in 2017. Interested in just about everything that has to do with software and always on the lookout for new things to learn.

Currently working to make the school hip with technologies such as GraphQL, Vue and Java at [IST](https://www.ist.com/). Before IST I spent the summer working at [Qvantel](https://qvantel.com), creating a PoC using primarily Scala, Grafana and the Elastic stack.

Previously worked on multiple school projects with customers like Qvantel (which you can read more about in the Orcd project section), [Softhouse](https://softhouse.se) creating an cable-viewing iOS app and creating an indoor navigation app at [BTH](https://www.bth.se) for Google Glass.
